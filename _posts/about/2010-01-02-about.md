Shubzilla is a rapper based from Renton, WA. She is 1/2 of Shubzilla x Bill Beats (You figure out which half!)

No stranger to the stage, Shubzilla turned to rap as a creative outlet after years of training as a dancer. Already a staple in nerdcore rap, Shubzilla is also a part  of the growing Seattle music community and beyond. She has worked and collaborated with Lex Lingo (as 9k1), Death Star, Klopfenpop, LEX The Lexicon Artist, as well as her family in rhyme The NPC Collective. Shubzilla has performed in venues such as the Nectar Lounge, Substation, The Lo-Fi, and the Funhouse. She has also performed along the west coast with Death*Star late 2017 and for 2016's Day Jobs Tour: West Coast Edition with Bill Beats, Kadesh Flow and EyeQ. Shubzilla has done out-of-states such as MAGfest, MAGWest's Jamspace (Santa Clara, CA), SXSW (Austin, TX), and Classic Game Fest (Austin, TX).

Shubzilla is a co-founder of The Nerdy People of Color Collective, a group of nerds of color who strive to promote diversity and inclusion in geek and nerd spaces. She is also a co-founder and a staff member for GeekGirlCon, a Seattle-based organization dedicated to celebrating the achievements of the marginalized geek.
