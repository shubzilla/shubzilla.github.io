Shubzilla is a rapper based from Renton, WA. She is 1/2 of Shubzilla x Bill Beats (You figure out which half!)

No stranger to the stage, Shubzilla turned to rap as a creative outlet after years of training as a dancer. Already a staple in nerdcore rap, Shubzilla is also a part  of the growing Seattle music community and beyond. She has worked and collaborated with Lex Lingo (as 9k1), Death*Star, Klopfenpop, LEX The Lexicon Artist, as well as her family in rhyme The NPC Collective. Shubzilla has performed in venues such as the Nectar Lounge, Substation, The Lo-Fi, and the Funhouse. She has also performed along the west coast with Death*Star late 2017 and for 2016's Day Jobs Tour: West Coast Edition with Bill Beats, Kadesh Flow and EyeQ. Shubzilla has done out-of-states such as MAGfest, MAGWest's Jamspace (Santa Clara, CA), SXSW (Austin, TX), and Classic Game Fest (Austin, TX).

Shubzilla is a co-founder of The Nerdy People of Color Collective, a group of nerds of color who strive to promote diversity and inclusion in geek and nerd spaces. She is also a co-founder and a staff member for GeekGirlCon, a Seattle-based organization dedicated to celebrating the achievements of the marginalized geek.
